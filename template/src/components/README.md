I think the general structure of the components folder is correct. I only have one doubt about it: are all components going to be created at the same level or did you think about creating specific subcomponents? I was imagining the following situation: let's say the `PageContainer` component will have a header. Such header logic is pretty complex so I would prefer to have it separated from all other logic. Such `PageHeader` component should be put inside the components folder at the same level as the `PageContainer`? Another option would be to create a sub folder for each component that is not reused so we would have something like this: `components/pageContainer/components/PageContainer`. When such component is reused we could move it to the root components folder. Obviously this approach can generate deep nesting levels so it might not be really optimal.
